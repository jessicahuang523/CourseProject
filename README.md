# Text Mining System - Topic Mining

Our functionality extension can be seen in the "Topic Mining" web page which we created. This web page gives a user the option to upload .txt files to generate a visualization from the uploaded files using an LDA algorithm. Clicking the submit button takes the user to an html page containing an interactive visualization which displays the output generated by the LDA in a clear and concise manner. The user is them able to browse through the different topics, adjust model parameters, and explore the visualization to find relevant information.
